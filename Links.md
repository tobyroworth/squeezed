[CHP's](http://forums.slimdevices.com/showpost.php?p=236633&postcount=31) c++ implementation. It can do transcoding using ffmpeg, but lacks a frontend. Uses SQL for the database.

[Kalle Happonen](https://sourceforge.net/userapps/phpwebsite/kallehapponen/)'s python implementation. I is quite recent, but seems to have all basics: playing music, control the squeezebox display, provide a web front-end.
